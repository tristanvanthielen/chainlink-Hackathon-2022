# Anvil
## A Chainlink Hackathon 2022 Project

# Concept
Upgrading game items always feels like a risk. Is the game server honest or am I just burning my items? With Anvil, using Chainlink VRF and in-game items as NFTs, gamers finally are guaranteed of the honesty of their upgrade chances. Using EVM for cross-chain compatibility of the framework, so game developers can build in a variety of ecosystems.
